             Something I like to occasionally do during a session is to speak in tongues. It can be a nice touch of flavor to have one
             of the orcs the party is talking to turn to their comrade and whisper something in unintelligible orcish.
             Or to have an elf lord curse at them with silken invectives. 
             Or have the strange, angelic being woken from an elder age quiz them in the stilted tones of a forgotten common tongue.

             My recent RPG is a retelling of the 1984 movie Red Dawn. In this one, my three PCs are local high school kids 
             in North Bend, WA. The Russians have invaded, 
             and they’ve run off into the woods and have started a guerilla insurgency.
